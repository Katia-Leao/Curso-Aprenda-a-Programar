Hi There!
This repository is an activity of an online course called "Learn to program" taught by ITuring Institute in Brazil.
This course was handled from august 22th to august 26th and the activities are divided by days.

The main poins I've learned were:
- Day one: make the GitHub account, connect to the computer and start uploading codes
- Day two - practice one: use `text in string ${var}`
- Day two - practice four: use array[i].property
